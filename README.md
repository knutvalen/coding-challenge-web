# The Frontend Developer Challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to get insights into how well the candidate handles technologies common to modern frontend development. The challenge is imaginary and attempts to be exciting.  

## The Challenge
A potential client has just discovered her fascination of Space Xâ€™s rockets and development into space. She dreams of one day setting foot on Mars in a Space X commercial tourist spaceship. The client contacted us and decided she needs an app to keep an eye on Space Xâ€™s launches. She came up with a list of requirements, too! The app requirements is listed below. 

### Functional requirements
* A countdown until the next launch. The countdown should be displayed in the format `[days]d [hours]t [minutes]m [seconds]s` - for example `0d 3h 51m 45s`. When the countdown reaches zero, it should display "Launched". 
* Some relevant details about the next launch, most importantly the name, launch date and link to its main video stream (if available). 
* An overview of 10 of the previous launches. The user should be able to load more than the initial 10. 
* The user should be able to click into any of the launches and read the relevant details about it.
* The user should be able to toggle the overview of the launches in ascending or descending order.

### Tech requirements
* Responsive web app that works well on both large and small screens.
* Use either React or Angular.

#### Option 1: React

* Use the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework. Use [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).
* Use CSS with [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) for all styling.

#### Option 2: Angular
* Use [Angular](https://angular.dev).
* Use CSS with Angular Component Templates for all styling. 

## Resources
Use an API to fetch the date needed. Here's an open-source REST API you can use:

## Deadline
There is no special requirements to deliver quickly. It is more important for the client that the app is delivered with high quality.

## Delivery
The app should be delivered as a link to a public git repository. 

## Review
Please include a markdown file with a short description of your solution, the thought process, and any points you would like to highlight. Aspects that will be reviewed:
* Use of "clean code" principles
* Git commits
* Delivery compared to the requirements
