# The Frontend Developer Challenge
The purpose of the challenge is to get insights into how well the candidate handles technologies common to modern frontend development. The challenge is imaginary and tries not to be boring. 

## The Challenge
A potential client has just discovered her fascination of Space Xâ€™s rockets and development into space. She dreams of one day setting foot on Mars in a Space X commercial tourist spaceship. The client decided she needs an app to keep an eye on Space Xâ€™s launches, right now! She came up with a list of requirements, too! Her app requirements is:

### Functional requirements
* A countdown until the next launch.
* Some relevant details about the next launch.
* An overview of some of the previous launches. The overview can be presented as a list, cards or anything else that gives an overview. The user should be able to see more (use pagination).  
* Possibility to click into any of the launches and read the relevant details about it.
* Possibility to toggle the overview of the launches in ascending or descending order.

### Tech requirements
* Responsive web app that works well on both large and small screens.
* Use either React or Angular.

#### Option 1: React

* Use the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework. Use [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).
* Use [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) for all styling.

#### Option 2: Angular
* Use [Angular](https://angular.dev).
* Use [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) with Angular Components for all styling. 

## Resources

## Deadline
There is no special requirements to deliver quickly. It is more important for the client that the app is delivered with high quality.

## Delivery
The app should be delivered as a link to a public git repository. 

## Review
Please include a markdown file with a short description of your solution, the thought process, and any points you would like to highlight. Aspects that will be reviewed:
* Use of "clean code" principles
* Git commits
* Delivery compared to the requirements
